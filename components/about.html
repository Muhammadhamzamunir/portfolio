      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about-intro-lead">What I am all about.</p>
      <p class="about-intro">
        A software engineer with a passion for turning challenging business needs into clean, scalable software. I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on the MERN stack, Laravel, and Vue.js—building web and mobile applications that solve real problems with an eye for performance and user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="about-detail">
        From Hasilpur to Lahore, I've grown from early curiosity in tech to shipping production applications. I completed my BS in Software Engineering at COMSATS University Lahore, cut my teeth as a Frontend Intern with React and Laravel, and now build full-stack and mobile solutions. I'm always looking to improve, experiment with new tools, and work with teams that care about quality and clarity in code.
      </p>
      <p class="about-detail">
        Whether it's REST APIs, responsive UIs, or cross-platform apps with React Native, I like to own the full picture—from idea to deployment—and keep the codebase maintainable and the UX smooth.
